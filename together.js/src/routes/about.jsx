          During the quarantine period, like many others, I found myself missing
          the simple pleasure of sharing funny or entertaining YouTube videos
          with friends. However, every attempt to sync up with friends resulted
          in frustrating experiencesâ€”either the sound wasn&apos;t right, or the
          videos were out of sync. Determined to find a solution, I embarked on
          a journey to create Together.

        <p className="text-lg">
          <ul>
            <li>
              - React: The user interface of Together is crafted with React,
              providing an intuitive and responsive design that enhances the
              overall user experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              - Node.js: Powering the server-side of Together is Node.js, a
              powerful runtime that enables high-performance and scalability,
              ensuring smooth video streaming.
            </li>
            <li>
              - Socket.io: Real-time communication is made possible through
              Socket.io, allowing users to synchronize their video-watching
              experience in real-time, making it as close to an in-person
              experience as possible.
